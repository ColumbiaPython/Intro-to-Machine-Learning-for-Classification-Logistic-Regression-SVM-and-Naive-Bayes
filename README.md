# Intro to Machine Learning for Classification: Logistic Regression, SVM, and Naive Bayes

## Part one: class organization
1. Finish research proposal in Github as a readme file: a. what is your research question? b. why your dataset can answer the question?
2. All students read out their reserach proposals

## Part two: programming
Introduction to Machine Learning for Classification

### Logistic Regression
1. example question, concepts, data analysis
2. Do we really understand the Log Loss Calculation in Logistic Regression? Instead of Mean Squared Error for Linear Regression, we use a cost function called Cross-Entropy, also known as Log Loss for Logistic regression.
3. Binary Classification
4. One vs. Rest: Multiple Categories Classification

### Naive Bayes:
Why Naive Bayes is naive?

### SVM: 
Explain how SVM works.

## Part three: project management

1. Upload new files into github (reference papers, data & codes)
2. Start HW2: Data collection, clearning and exploration
